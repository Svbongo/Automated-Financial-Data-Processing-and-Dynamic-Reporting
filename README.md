   - Profit and Loss statements  
   - Balance Sheets  
   - Cash Flow statements  
   - Budget vs Actuals Analysis  

2. **Market and External Data:**  
   - Inflation rates, GDP, and interest rates  
   - Competitor performance benchmarks  

3. **AI-Generated Data:**  
   - Simulated market conditions  
   - Scenario-based financial projections  

**Challenges Addressed:**  
- Data completeness, consistency, and accuracy issues

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation

The data preparation phase includes:

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handling missing values using imputation techniques.  
   - Standardizing currency and date formats.  
   - Removing redundant records.  

2. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Scaling and encoding data for modeling.  
   - Feature engineering to derive new insights such as growth rates and revenue ratios.  

3. **Data Splitting:**

## üß† Modeling

We utilized advanced machine learning models to provide predictive insights:

### **1. Time-Series Forecasting Models:**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Captures sequential dependencies for long-term predictions.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units):** Efficient for real-time forecasting updates.
- **SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Incorporates seasonality patterns for financial data.

### **2. Anomaly Detection:**
- **Isolation Forest:** Identifies outliers in financial metrics.
- **Autoencoders:** Detect unexpected fluctuations in financial data.

### **3. Generative AI for Scenario Analysis:**
- Used **LLMs (Large Language Models)** such as OpenAI API to analyze qualitative financial insights.
- Integrated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve forecasting accuracy.

## üìà Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated based on the following metrics:

1. **Time-Series Forecasting Metrics:**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

2. **Anomaly Detection Metrics:**
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-score for anomaly identification.

3. **Generative AI Evaluation:**
   - Relevance and accuracy of AI-generated insights.
   - User satisfaction scores and governance compliance.
